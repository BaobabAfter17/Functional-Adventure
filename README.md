# Background
The Dark Lord has come back!!

Muggles and non-pure typed wizards and witches are locked up in Azkaban. You, the Chosen One, is the only hope of the wizarding world to overthrow the tyranny. But you are too weak to fight You-Know-Who.

But there is hope! You must collect all three Deathly Hallows. ** The Elder Wand, the Invisibility Cloak, and the Resurrection Stone ** Each piece alone is alredy very strong, yet together they are invincible...

For thousands of years, people tried to collect them, but no one ever succeeded...Believe me or not, I know they are all here, in Diagon Valley, the most mundane place in wizarding world... The most precious lies in everyday life people always ignore.

So go, my courageous wizard! Go and find them!!!
